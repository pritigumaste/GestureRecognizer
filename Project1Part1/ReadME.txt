--------------------- Project 1 Part 1 : Drawable canvas ------------------------

How to run:
    Run "Proj1Part1.py" to open up a drawable canvas. 


Application usuage and Implementation details:
	a). We have used Visual Studio as our IDE as we are coding in Python.
	b). To instantiate the Canvas, click on the python file and it will open a drawable canvas. 
	c). To listen to mouse touch events, we have used two functions:
		1). To get the initial click point co-ordinates and the co-ordinates during the mouse drag (Line 13 - get_xy() funtion).
		2). This method is used to create a line as and when the co-ordinates are updated due to mouse drag (Line 19 - draw() funtion). 
	d). clear() funtion on line 28 is to clear the canvas, which can be done by right clicking the mouse.


We have added a demo video (video_demo.mkv) of the explanation of the code and application running.
