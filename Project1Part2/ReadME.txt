--------------------- Project 1 Part 2 : Online/Live Recognition ------------------------

How to run:
    Run "Proj1Part2.py" to open up a drawable canvas. 


Application usuage and Implementation details:
	a). We have used Visual Studio as our IDE as we are coding in Python.
	b). To instantiate the Canvas, click on the python file and it will open a drawable canvas. 
	c). We have used the templates class, inorder to store all the templates of the 16 figures. 
	d). We have implemented the recognizer using the recognizer class, which inturns takes the output on the canvas, 
		matches the points with the given templates and gives the figure/shape name and also prints the score. 
	e). Rotation/scaling + translation / resampling has been implemented in the same class.  
	d). The output of the score and shape name has been displayed on the canvas.


We have added a demo video (video_demo.mkv) of the explanation of the code and application running.
