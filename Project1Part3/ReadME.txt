How to run:
    Run "Proj1Part3.py" to open up a drawable canvas. 


Application usuage and Implementation details:
	a). We have used Visual Studio as our IDE as we are coding in Python.
	b). In this offline recognition, we are using 1$ algorithm to identify the gesture type and the accuracy of recognition 
		from a given set of gesture templates. 
	c). We have a dataset of 10 users, wherein each user comprises of all the 16 gestures and 10 templates per gesture. 
	d). These gesture types will be randoly choosen and then compared to the templates that we have. The video demo consists of demo for 1 user only.
