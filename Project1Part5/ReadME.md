--------------------- Project 1 Part 5 : Exploring data from people ------------------------




-- Implementation details:

	a). We have run the offline recognition test on the data collected in Part4.

	b). In this part, We have added the ".csv" logfile after running Part3 on Part4 user collected data.

	c). After importing the Part4 user collected dataset, we generated the heatmap image and the feature data on GHoST application, these files are exported and added in the zip file. 

	d). Insights based on the generated heatmap image: 
		1). Star and pig-tail gestures are more towards orange and red in color, indicating that there are maximum data points together.
		2). Figures such as caret and V have lesser magnitude of data through the lines. 
		3). Some parts of arrow can be seen having maximum data points along the line. 
		4). Pigtail and star had the high variability.



-- We have added a demo video (video_demo.mkv) of the explanation of the code and application running. 
	video_demo1.mkv consists of demo for 1 sample of all the 16 gestures.
